#30 Days of JavaScript - Drum Kit
###Monday June, 21, 2020 - 12:19 AM

It was a bit overwhelming creating this project because I have not touched JavaScript in a while. Even though I'm a bit rusty, the project helped me gain a few of the concepts back into my mind again. After completing this first one, I self-doubted my abilities, but I had to realign my thoughts and tell myself that it's only the beginning, and there's more to come. Stay grounded and focus.
